## [v1.4.0] - 2026-07-30

### Added
- **Grayscale Shortcut ('G')**: Added `'G'` keyboard shortcut on both YouTube and Instagram to toggle Grayscale Mode dynamically with toast notification feedback.

## [v1.3.1] - 2026-07-30

### Changed
- **Rollback Mobile Support & Phone UI Matching**: Reverted mobile/phone specific layout adjustments and wildcard matching rules, restricting extension URL matching back to desktop-only domains (`https://www.youtube.com/*`, `https://youtube.com/*`, `https://www.instagram.com/*`, `https://instagram.com/*`).

## [v1.3.0] - 2026-07-18

> [!WARNING]
> Mobile support for Firefox Android is in an initial, experimental testing phase. Some features may not function fully on mobile and are subject to further testing and changes.

### Added

- **YouTube Mobile Selectors**: Added and qualified selectors for mobile recommendations, comments, and Shorts.
- **Instagram Mobile Selectors**: Added selectors to collapse bottom nav bar spacing for hidden items.

### Changed
- **Touch-Isolated Mobile Overrides**: Isolated mobile popup dimensions to touch-only screen media queries (`hover: none`) to prevent modifying desktop layout.

### Fixed
- **Instagram Reels Viewer Hiding**: Removed generated class selectors that broke profile Reels viewing when comments/likes were hidden.
- **Firefox Layout Squeezing**: Added `scrollbar-width: thin` to keep Firefox layout consistent with Chrome scrollbar sizing.
- **Desktop Popup Sizing**: Restored and protected original desktop styling.

## [v1.2.7] - 2026-07-15

### Changed
- **Reset Options Scope**: Restructured the Reset button behavior so that clicking it resets options only for the currently active platform (YouTube or Instagram) rather than wiping all extension settings.
- **Reset Button on Unsupported Pages**: The Reset button is now rendered but disabled (with reduced opacity and helper tooltips) when browsing unsupported websites ("Oops" view) instead of being hidden.
- **Footer Layout & Icons**: Centered the bottom support heart icon absolutely to guarantee precise horizontal alignment, and updated the contact/feedback icon to a standard envelope design.

## [v1.2.6] - 2026-06-30

### Added
- **Light/Dark Theme Toggle**: Added a header button to switch between dark and light appearance modes with full theme-aware styling.
- **Auto Site Detection & Selector**: Introduced smart platform detection and a header-based dropdown menu to choose between sites manually.
- **Unsupported Site Message**: Added a centered, snug warning card ("Oops!") shown dynamically when visiting unsupported websites.
- **Scroll UX Indicator**: Introduced top and bottom gradient fade masks with a bouncing scroll arrow to signal scrollable options.
- **Audio Only Mode Keyboard Shortcut**: Added key shortcut `'A'` on YouTube to toggle Audio Only Mode dynamically back and forth (active only when not typing in text fields).
- **Reset Button Spin Animation**: Added an interactive spin animation to the Reset icon when clicked to provide responsive visual feedback.

### Changed
- **Controls Layout**: Shifted the Reset button from the header to the controls row below, placing it side-by-side with the global Feed Free Toggle in a balanced layout (with a keyboard shortcut hint added under settings).
- Patched version to `v1.2.6` across all manifests and documentation.

## [v1.2.5] - 2026-06-28

### Added
- **YouTube Hide Search Shorts**: Added a dedicated "Hide Search Shorts" option to hide Shorts shelf carousels and lockup results completely from search pages, removing blank spacing and metadata (like views/menus) entirely.
- **YouTube Search Notification**: Displays a sleek, premium, auto-dismissing toast at the top-center of the page (below the search bar) when searching on YouTube and some Shorts results are hidden, letting the user know they can disable the "Hide Search Shorts" feature to view them.
- **Instagram DM Buttons**: Hides the *navigation/header Direct Messages button/icon, the floating "Messages" pill button at the bottom right corner, and their unread notification badges* when the "Hide DMs" option is enabled.
- **Instagram Notification Tooltips**: Hides the floating notification summary tooltips (popups showing likes, comments, and follow updates) when "Hide Notifications" is enabled.

### Fixed
- **YouTube Search Shorts**: Fixed search results layout showing empty spacings, views counts, and 3-dot menus for hidden Shorts by hiding the entire video renderer containers completely on search pages.

### Changed
- **YouTube settings**: Renamed **"Music Mode"** to **"Audio Only Mode"** (and its visualizer to **"Audio Only Overlay"**) to better reflect its versatility for podcasts, video essays, and lectures as well as music.

  - **Hide Notifications**: Added a new option to hide the notifications bell icon and activity links from the top bar and sidebar navigation.

- **Accessibility Improvements**: Added dynamic `aria-label` attributes and keyboard `:focus-visible` outlines to the music mode UI buttons.

## [v1.2.1] - 2026-06-10

### Added

### Fixed
- **YouTube End-Screens Toggle**: Fixed a bug where YouTube end screen suggestions and overlay elements remained hidden after toggling the option off. Added style clearing to reset display overrides.
- **YouTube Report History Sidebar Divider**: Fixed an issue where hiding "Report history" left an extra visual separator line above the guide footer. Now hides adjacent divider elements dynamically.


## [v1.2.0] - 2026-06-09

### Added
- **Global Grayscale Mode**: Dynamic filter settings mapping `grayscale(100%)` to the root `html` element on both YouTube and Instagram to eliminate bright colors and reduce addictive scrolling without layout shifts.
- **YouTube Controls**:
  - **Hide Entire Sidebar**: Option to completely hide the sidebar on the video watch page, auto-stretching the player container symmetrically.
  - **Hide End Screens**: Removes video card overlays, autoplay suggestions, and modern fullscreen or suggestion videowalls at the end of videos, utilizing a recursive shadow root MutationObserver for style preservation across video load resets.
  - **Hide Subscriptions**: Hides subscription feed contents on `/feed/subscriptions` and guide links/sidebar entries.
  - **Hide Explore**: Hides the entire "Explore" link and section from the guide/sidebar.

  - **Hide Shorts Everywhere**: Option to completely hide the Shorts tab and video thumbnails from channel pages, locking the parent "Hide Shorts" toggle.
- **Instagram Controls**:
  - **Hide Stories (Home)**: Option to remove the top stories tray from the home feed.
  - **Hide Stories Everywhere**: Option to completely hide the stories tray, highlights, and story rings (plus auto-redirect from `/stories/`), locking the "Hide Stories (Home)" option to active/disabled.
  - **Square Profile Photos**: Renders profile pictures/avatars, highlights, story rings, and story tray borders as soft squares cleanly scoped to prevent other elements from distorting.
  - **Hide Notes**: Hides status note bubbles from profile pictures and inbox lists.
  - **Hide Likes**: Scopes metrics hiding specifically to likes counts on posts, reels, hover cards, and profile follower counts.
  - **Hide Comments**: Unified comments hiding toggle that hides comment counts, comment icons, comment list lines, and comment textareas/inputs while preserving the post author's original caption.
  - **Instagram Comments Restoration**: Hidden comments are tagged with `data-ff-comment-hidden` attributes, enabling instant restoration of comments when the feature is disabled without page reloads.
  - **Hide Notifications**: Hides the notifications/activity tab from the sidebar.
- **Music Visualizer Pause state Synchronization**: Wave-bar animation automatically halts when the active YouTube video element is paused or ended.
- **Support & Feedback Channel**: Prefilled support `mailto` link added directly inside the popup footer and README, automatically formatting standard extension subject tags.

### Changed
- **Instagram Reels Navigation Hiding**: Scopes the Reels sidebar/navigation hiding rule to target only items outside of the `<main>` container (using `:not(main a)`). This ensures the Reels tab and grid on user profile pages remain visible and accessible while hiding it from the navigation menus.

### Fixed
- **YouTube Profile Page Videos Hiding**: Scoped homepage nuke selectors strictly to `page-subtype="home"` and homepage root paths, resolving a bug where video grid lists on user profile and channel pages were hidden when "Hide Home Feed" was enabled.
- **YouTube Shorts in Playlists/Channels**: Corrected shorts rules to ignore videos listed inside playlist containers and channel pages, resolving a bug where enabling "Hide Shorts" would incorrectly block Shorts from rendering inside playlists.
- **Instagram Saved Section Posts/Reels**: Scoped main feed hiding rules strictly to homepage root paths, allowing saved posts and reels to render successfully.
- **Instagram Profile/Details Navigation**: Refined reels and explore links selectors to ignore page body frames (`main`), resolving navigation glitches when view items were selected.
