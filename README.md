## Features

### Popup controls (v1.6.0)
- Use the platform icon menu for Auto detect, YouTube, or Instagram, and the adjacent theme button for light or dark appearance.
- Feed Free ON/OFF and Reset share one row. Reset applies only to the selected platform and is disabled on unsupported sites.
- Scroll through the full settings list; the animated arrow indicates more options below. Nested settings keep indented labels and full-width dividers.
- When both Instagram DM options are enabled, choose Profile or Saved in the redirect dropdown. It is disabled while Feed Free is off and remembers your choice.

The screenshots above show the earlier popup; the current source version is v1.6.0. Store badges describe the published versions.

### YouTube
- **Hide Home Feed** — Remove the algorithmic video grid from youtube.com.
- **Hide Shorts** — Remove Shorts from homepage, sidebar, and channel profile pages.
- **Hide Search Shorts** — Remove Shorts shelves and video results completely from search pages, with a smart auto-dismissing toast at the top-center of the page notifying you when results are hidden.
- **Hide Recommendations** — Clear suggested recommendations next to/below the player and playlist pages (leaves playlists visible).
- **Clean Player** — Replace the watch sidebar with a centered player, capped at 1120px and sized to the available height, with responsive side margins and rounded corners. Works in narrow desktop windows; theater, fullscreen, and miniplayer retain native sizing.
- **Keep Playlist Below Player** — Child option under Clean Player to keep the current playlist beneath the video. Turn it off for a single-player view. Existing Hide Entire Sidebar preferences migrate with playlists hidden.
- **Blur Thumbnails** — Blur video thumbnails and preview media without blurring titles, avatars, or the playing video. Off by default. When enabled, a slider beneath the toggle adjusts blur strength from 1–24px and remembers your choice.
- **Hide Comments** — Remove the entire comments section.
- **Hide End Screens** — Remove video card overlays at the end of videos.
- **Hide Subscriptions** — Remove Subscriptions link from guide/sidebar.
- **Hide Explore** — Remove Trending/Explore links from guide/sidebar.
- **Hide Report History** — Remove Report History link from guide/sidebar.
- **Hide Notifications** — Remove the notifications bell and activity links from the top bar and sidebar.
- **Hide More from YouTube** — Remove the "More from YouTube" category block from the guide/sidebar.
- **Audio Only Mode** — Black out the video player (keep audio playing) with a **draggable** floating toggle button on the player UI to switch back-and-forth directly, an optional screen visual overlay, independent execution from the master switch, and keyboard shortcut (`'A'`) with floating toast notification.
- **Grayscale Mode ('G')** — Turn YouTube completely black & white with keyboard shortcut (`'G'`), floating toast notification, and independent execution from the master switch.

### Instagram
- **Following Feed** — Auto-redirect to the Following timeline instead of the algorithmic Home feed.
- **Redirect to DMs** — Go straight to `/direct/inbox/` on open instead of the feed.
- **Hide DMs** — Remove DM navigation (header/sidebar Message buttons, floating bottom-right Messages pill, unread count badges) and redirect away from the messages inbox.
- **Hide Reels** — Remove Reels from sidebar/navigation menus (keeping profile reels visible) and auto-redirect away from `/reels/`.
- **Hide Explore** — Remove the Explore tab and auto-redirect.
- **Hide Professional Dashboard** — Remove Professional Dashboard link and icon from the sidebar navigation on creator/business profiles.
- **Hide Stories (Home)** — Remove the top stories tray from the home feed.
- **Hide Stories Everywhere** — Completely remove the stories tray, highlights, and story rings (plus auto-redirect from `/stories/`).
- **Square Profile Photos** — Render profile pictures and story rings as soft squares.
- **Hide Notes** — Block status note bubbles from profiles and inbox.
- **Hide Comments & Likes Count** — Hide comment sections, comments count, and post likes count (while keeping the interactive Like, Comment, Share, and Save button icons visible).
- **Hide Notifications** — Remove notifications tab from sidebar, hide floating notification tooltips (Like/Comment/Follow popups), and strip unread badges.
- **Conflict Resolution** — Choose redirect target (Profile or Saved) when both "Redirect to DMs" and "Hide DMs" are enabled simultaneously.
- **Grayscale Mode ('G')** — Turn Instagram completely black & white with keyboard shortcut (`'G'`), floating toast notification, and independent execution from the master switch.

### Global
- **Master toggle** — Enable/disable all feed blocking at once (Feed Free Active / Inactive).
- **Independent Appearance Modes** — Audio Only Mode & Grayscale Mode run independently of master toggle so you can stay in dark/black-and-white mode anytime via shortcuts `'A'` and `'G'`.
- **Auto Site Detection & Selector** — Smart platform detection with a manual dropdown to switch between YouTube, Instagram, or Auto mode. Shows a friendly unsupported site message with supported platform info when visiting other sites.
- **Light/Dark Theme Toggle** — Dynamically switch between dark and light appearance modes with a button in the header.
- **Real-time sync** — Changes apply across all open tabs instantly.
- **SPA-proof** — Works through client-side navigation without requiring a page reload.
- **Firefox + Chrome** — Supports both browsers from the same codebase.
- **Core Engine Optimization** — Synchronous Anti-Flicker scripts ensure instant, zero-delay node filtering during Single-Page Application (SPA) transitions.

## How It Works

### Semantic CSS Selectors
Social media platforms (especially Instagram) use obfuscated, dynamically generated CSS classes that change frequently with code updates. To maintain durability and prevent breaks, Feed Free targets stable structural selectors—such as tag names, attribute selectors (e.g. `a[href^="/reels"]`), and ARIA labels (e.g. `svg[aria-label="Reels"]`)—rather than raw CSS class names.

### CSS Injection
Uses dynamic `<style>` tag element injection appended directly to the `document.documentElement`. This ensures maximum compatibility across browser platforms (Chrome and Firefox) and handles CSS updates natively in isolated MV3 worlds without requiring page reloads. 

### State Management
Three-layer sync for reliability:
1. **Message broadcasting** — Popup sends state directly to all matching content scripts via `chrome.tabs.sendMessage`
2. **Storage change listener** — `chrome.storage.onChanged` catches cross-tab updates instantly
3. **Polling fallback** — Content scripts poll `chrome.storage.local` every 2 seconds via `setInterval` (catches cases where message delivery fails)

### SPA Navigation Detection
`DOMPatron` uses a `MutationObserver` mapped strictly to URL changes to instantly detect SPA navigations. We deliberately decouple the observer trigger from our CSS style injections to prevent infinite mutation loops while guaranteeing zero-delay instant filtering, even when returning to an idle tab.

### Anti-Flicker
A `document_start` content script (`bootstrap/antiflicker.ts`) loads the saved state synchronously and injects a `<style>` block to hide feed elements **before the page renders**. The main content script removes this style once it takes over with the dynamically injected style tag.

### Heartbeat Recovery
A 3-second `setInterval` in each content script periodically re-applies CSS rules. This catches edge cases where page scripts override or flush the injected stylesheet.

## Roadmap

### Phase 2 — The Unified Unbiased Engine *(Core Feature)*
The main upcoming feature is a shared data engine that feeds unmanipulated, randomly discovered, or educational content to both platforms, creating a custom Unbiased Feed!
- **YouTube Injection**: Pull unbiased random videos/shorts into a custom or home feed.
- **Instagram Side-Injection**: Inject insta reels randomly if possible by any means (or cross-platform random YouTube Shorts) directly into the Instagram interface, else any other platform resources (like wikipedia random content).
- **Architecture Designed for Expansion**: The engine's data pipeline will feed into any supported platform beyond YouTube and Instagram.

### Phase 3 — The Lock *(Behavioral Control)*
Add intentional friction to your social media usage for a true digital detox.

> *Note: These are just a basic theoretical outline. Features may be reimagined or changed entirely as development continues. (Open to new ideas and suggestions!)*
